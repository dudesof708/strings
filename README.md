# Game and Software Strings

Welcome to the **Dudes of 708** game and software strings repository! We'd appreciate it if you helped us out with translating or contributing to the text in our software and games so we can make it more accessible to other people.

*Alternatively, this is actually just used to make funny comments. So we don't mind if you react* :trollface: *to all of our commits and pull requests.*

We use the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) to denote what language each string is from, and you can find the translations in each of their respective folders. (This is the two-letter code in the fourth column of the Wikipedia table.) Additionally, we use a country sub-code as defined by the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) standard for denoting what country the language is for.

This is standard practice among many localized software, and an example for American English would be `en-US`. This game is developed in American English, and therefore the localization project for this langauge should always be 100% complete and other languages should be translated from this reference language.
